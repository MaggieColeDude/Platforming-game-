## A short logic chart about the dynamics of jumping in the short platformer. The dynamics of the air will not follow normal physic so there will be no air resistance. If the player makes contact with the ground the boolean varibles will be set to true, if they are not on the ground the boolean will be set to false. This means the player can only walk when in contact with the ground. This same logic is used for the jump button as well. When the arrow key is released the player will stop moving and start to decelerate. When the space bar is released the player will fall rather than move forward. Further, to prevent the player from over using the jump button when space is pressed the both booleans will be set to false.
