## There are three parts to each level, each should become harder as the player goes on. This first level is primarily a tutorial to show how the mechanics of the game work as well as establish a story. Gary is stuck at work when he gets a call to pick up the flowers he ordered for Linsey. He tries to leave the office but is pestered by nosey co-workers. If he gets near the coworkers he will take one heart of damage. Along the way, the player can pick up notes which explain their relationship. They can also pick up petals which add health. The player can also talk with a recurring NPC, a little girl with no name explaining how she lost a teddy bear and her dad is too busy to fix it. Later on, it's revealed the little girl is a ghost and we find the teddy bear at her grave. She will be a recurring character. I may make it so the little girl is Lindsey. I may have to take things out and shorten the levels depending on my skill level. 

# Logic Flow 
![LogicFlow](https://github.com/MaggieColeDude/Platforming-game-/blob/main/Images/Logic%20flow%20Chart.png)
## A short logic chart about the dynamics of jumping in the short platformer. The dynamics of the air will not follow normal physics so there will be no air resistance. If the player makes contact with the ground the boolean variables will be set to true, if they are not on the ground the boolean will be set to false. This means the player can only walk when in contact with the ground. This same logic is used for the jump button as well. When the arrow key is released the player will stop moving and start to decelerate. When the space bar is released the player will fall rather than move forward. Further, to prevent the player from overusing the jump button when space is pressed both booleans will be set to false.
